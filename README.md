I'm Ricardo Guerrero from Costa Rica, and this will be my example of messaging app for my Zemoga Recruiting process.

## Zemoga Post App

To run the project you must have Xcode, so download the project from github and place it on your computer, for simplicity put on the desktop so find it faster to decompress it and then open it.

I used something simple to this app and clasify the files by ViewModel to fetch de information,  then the Models to know how the data will come from the API and finally, the Views so in there are some functions as well all the UI.

For some time issues was develop with SwiftUI, unit testing had no much time to do so. I asked for more time but really hadnt the time beacuse of work. As for third-parties I didnt use something like that, I didnt see the need of that but should be something fun to tried out.

Any doubts of how I did something, I could add more comments or guide you through it. I wish had more time to do this but had a crazy weeking becuase some things go south with the realese and break many things.

Thanks again for the opportunity.
